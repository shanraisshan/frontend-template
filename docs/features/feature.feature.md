# Feature Page Feature

## Overview
The Feature page is the main workspace of the application where core functionality is implemented. This page serves as a placeholder for your custom application features and can be customized based on your project requirements.

## Route
- **Path**: `/feature`
- **Component**: `app/feature/page.tsx`

## Current Implementation

### Basic Structure
The Feature page currently displays a simple placeholder message. This is intentionally minimal to allow developers to build their custom functionality without needing to remove boilerplate code.

- Centered text: "this is a feature page"
- Full viewport height layout
- Chakra UI components
