# HOOKS-README
contains all the details, scripts, and instructions for the hooks

## Hook Events Overview - [Official 9 Hooks](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/hooks-guide)
Claude Code provides several hook events that run at different points in the workflow:
1. PreToolUse: Runs before tool calls (can block them)
2. PostToolUse: Runs after tool calls complete
3. UserPromptSubmit: Runs when the user submits a prompt, before Claude processes it
4. Notification: Runs when Claude Code sends notifications
5. Stop: Runs when Claude Code finishes responding
6. SubagentStop: Runs when subagent tasks complete
7. PreCompact: Runs before Claude Code is about to run a compact operation
8. SessionStart: Runs when Claude Code starts a new session or resumes an existing session
9. SessionEnd: Runs when Claude Code session ends

## Prerequisites

Before using hooks, ensure you have **Python 3** installed on your system.

### Required Software

#### All Platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- **Python 3**: Required for running the hook scripts
- Verify installation: `python3 --version`

**Installation Instructions:**
- **Windows**: Download from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or install via `winget install Python.Python.3`
- **macOS**: Install via `brew install python3` (requires [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/))
- **Linux**: Install via `sudo apt install python3` (Ubuntu/Debian) or `sudo yum install python3` (RHEL/CentOS)

### Audio Players (Optional - Automatically Detected)

The hook scripts automatically detect and use the appropriate audio player for your platform:

- **macOS**: Uses `afplay` (built-in, no installation needed)
- **Linux**: Uses `paplay` from `pulseaudio-utils` - install via `sudo apt install pulseaudio-utils`
- **Windows**: Uses built-in `winsound` module (included with Python)

### How Hooks Are Executed

The hooks are configured in `.claude/settings.json` to run directly with Python 3:

```json
{
  "type": "command",
  "command": "python3 .claude/hooks/scripts/hooks.py"
}
```

## Configuring Hooks (Enable/Disable)

Hooks can be easily enabled or disabled at both the global and individual levels.

### Disable All Hooks at Once

Edit `.claude/settings.local.json` and set:
```json
{
  "disableAllHooks": true
}
```

**Note:** The `.claude/settings.local.json` file is git-ignored, so each user can configure their own hook preferences without affecting the team's shared settings in `.claude/settings.json`.

### Disable Individual Hooks

For granular control, you can disable specific hooks by editing the hooks configuration files.

#### Configuration Files

There are two configuration files for managing individual hooks:

1. **`.claude/hooks/config/hooks-config.json`** - The shared/default configuration that is committed to git
2. **`.claude/hooks/config/hooks-config.local.json`** - Your personal overrides (git-ignored)

The local config file (`.local.json`) takes precedence over the shared config, allowing each developer to customize their hook behavior without affecting the team.

#### Shared Configuration

Edit `.claude/hooks/config/hooks-config.json` for team-wide defaults:

```json
{
  "disableLogging": false,
  "disablePreToolUseHook": false,
  "disablePostToolUseHook": false,
  "disableUserPromptSubmitHook": false,
  "disableNotificationHook": false,
  "disableStopHook": false,
  "disableSubagentStopHook": false,
  "disablePreCompactHook": false,
  "disableSessionStartHook": false,
  "disableSessionEndHook": false
}
```

**Configuration Options:**
- `disableLogging`: Set to `true` to disable logging hook events to `.claude/hooks/logs/hooks-log.jsonl` (useful to prevent log file growth)

#### Local Configuration (Personal Overrides)

Create or edit `.claude/hooks/config/hooks-config.local.json` for personal preferences:

```json
{
  "disableLogging": true,
  "disablePostToolUseHook": true,
  "disableSessionStartHook": true
}
```

In this example, logging is disabled, and the PostToolUse and SessionStart hooks are overridden locally. All other hooks will use the shared configuration values.

**Note:** Individual hook toggles are checked by the hook script (`.claude/hooks/scripts/hooks.py`). Local settings override shared settings, and if a hook is disabled, the script exits silently without playing any sounds or executing hook logic.
